You can help me fix this problem:

Please install ["Log Collector"](http://www.appbrain.com/app/com.xtralogic.android.logcollector) from Android Market. Now wait for a Force Close of SayMyName and start "Log Collector"-app afterwards. It will prompt you to send your device log (doesn't contain any private information... if so, I will ignore it ;)) to somebody. Send it to me and maybe I can fix it.
