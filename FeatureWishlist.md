## read names AFTER first white space ##
"In my contact list I use a person's title (Mr., Miss, Mrs., etc). I'd like the option to start reading the name at the first white space so I don't have to hear "Mr. John Doe" and just hear "John Doe"." see [issue 45](https://code.google.com/p/roadtoadc/issues/detail?id=45).
or:
## exclude strings ##
don't read "mrs.", "mr." ...

## Spelling ##
"is there a way to change the way it says a name? For instance, if that someone special is calling, can it say "Your sweetie is calling" or someone u don't like have it say "Moron"? Anyway, I think u get the question. For me inparticular, its miss pronouncing my daughters name, which is spelled weird."
-> use nicknames in your addressbook

## Contact Chooser enhancement ##
"I think that having an "ungrouped" group selection would be quite handy...I've added some contacts via the android system, and never added them to a group, now I don't remember who I added.

Something else handy would be if the listing of all contacts showed what groups each one belonged to."

## Test formatstring ##
Instantly hear your new formatstring while editing it

## Don't read special characters ##
ignore **, : etc**

## Exclude what's between special characters ##
Might it be possible to exclude what is between special characters so the announcement is "Joe Smith" when the contact listing reads "Joe [contractor](contractor.md) Smith" or "Joe [& Sally] Smith"?
