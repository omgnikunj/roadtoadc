Please see if there's an update available at the Android Market before you report a problem.

# Try that if you experience any problems #
Uninstall SayMyName and [install it](http://www.appbrain.com/app/org.mailboxer.saymyname) again. This step fixes problems with widget and weird settings.

Restarting your phone could help too. :)

# It [forces close](http://code.google.com/p/roadtoadc/wiki/ForceClose) / freezes / ... #

Please install "Log Collector" from Android Market. Now wait for a Force Close of SayMyName and start "Log Collector"-app afterwards. It will prompt you to send your device log (doesn't contain any private information... if so, I will ignore it ;)) to somebody. Send it to me and maybe I can fix it.

# It only says "unknown" #

Send me a mail and tell me which phone you use, which version it runs, ...

# It doesn't speak at all #

**Most problems will disappear after restarting your phone!**

If not:
  * turn up your ringer's volume. Maybe it's just too quiet for you.
  * open SayMyName. It will tell you if TTS isn't installed, or there are some files missing.

  * restart your phone. Sometimes there's something completely wrong, until you restart your phone.

  * [follow these steps](http://code.google.com/p/roadtoadc/wiki/ForceClose) and send me the log.

  * go to "Speech settings" in SayMyName and try the TTS-Test there
  * If you installed [TTS](http://code.google.com/p/eyes-free/) for the first time, it downloads some voice-datas (only 2MB). Wait for this and try again / restart your phone.

  * Test doesn't work after a reboot? TTS seems to be not working. So please read: [Troubleshooting TTS](http://code.google.com/p/eyes-free/wiki/TTSTroubleshooting)

If there's no update and none of the steps above fixed your problem, [file a bug](http://code.google.com/p/roadtoadc/issues/entry) or send me a mail.

Thanks a lot for your feedback. I hope you enjoy SayMyName!
