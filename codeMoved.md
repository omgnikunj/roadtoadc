## Code moved! ##

Hello,

Thanks for your interest! You can find up-to-date code at [GitHub](http://github.com/TomTasche/SayMyName). If you're still interested in the old, buggy, strange code hosted here at Google Code you can mess around with it [here](http://code.google.com/p/roadtoadc/source/browse/).

Good luck and tell me what cool things you did with my code! :)

Tom
